# DakRSA
This work is delivering an RSA cryptosystem which can be used to encrypt/decrypt files and texts between two parties and applying digital signature signing and verifying between the two of them

Please download the Crypto zip file first, extract it, and add the extracted folder to the \Lib\site-packages of the current project you are working on.
Then, download RSA.py and open it within the same package you installed Crypto on. And run it.

I hope that the program will be useful to everyone, and if you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.
